# Java-GUI-Calculator
This is a simple Java calculator with a fancy GUI interface.  In order to have visible buttons you will need to define where the folder with the buttons is located.  

Example for Linux:

button1.setIcon(new ImageIcon("/home/user/pictures/Buttons/GimpBotton1.jpg"));

Example for Windows:

button1.setIcon(new ImageIcon("C:\\Users\\username\\Pictures\\Buttons\\GimpBotton1.jpg"));
