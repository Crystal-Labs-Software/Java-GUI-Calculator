# Java-GUI-Calculator
  This is a simple Java calculator with a fancy GUI interface.  Feel free to make a pull request as I'm still improving this project.  Right now I'm trying to change the logic so I can add numbers in a sequence without pressing equals each time.  In order to have visible buttons you will need to define where the folder with the buttons is located.

Example for Linux:

button1.setIcon(new ImageIcon("/home/username/pictures/Buttons/GimpBotton1.jpg"));

Example for Windows:

button1.setIcon(new ImageIcon("C:\\\Users\\\username\\\Pictures\\\Buttons\\\GimpBotton1.jpg"));
